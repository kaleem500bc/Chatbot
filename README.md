# Chatbot: Text and Voice

This project is a versatile chatbot that can handle both text and voice inputs. It uses OpenAI's GPT model for text-based responses and an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for transcribing voice inputs. The chat history is stored and can be loaded for reference.

## Features

- **Text Input:** You can enter text queries, and the chatbot will respond accordingly using OpenAI's GPT model.

- **Voice Input:** You can record voice messages, and the chatbot will transcribe them and provide responses based on the transcribed text.

- **Chat History:** The chatbot keeps a history of conversations, allowing you to load previous interactions for reference.
